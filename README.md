# Hi, Welcome to AgroSat
## Problem Steatement
Develop a system that uses satellite image and give an aprox calculation of change in wetland and dryland of a perticular area.
## Project In Nutshell
Wetland â€“ Dryland Statistics Using Satellite Image:
<ul>
<li>	
  Using Machine Learning and Satellite Image Processing, system identifies wet land from Satellite Image  and calculate area of wetland,changes happened from last 10 years 
</li>
<li> 
  Using Fully Convolutional Network(FCN) Architecture, Integrated with a web application for user friendliness 
</li>
<li>
  Tools Used : TensorFlow, Keras, Scikit learn, NumPy, matplotlib, MySQL
</li>
</ul>
